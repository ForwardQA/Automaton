===========

* Added support for Swing JTabbedPane text selector
* Removed Groovy from user classpath - Groovy dependency added by user is required now

Release 1.1.0 (July 27, 2014)
===========

* Fixed bug #9 - Automaton's TimerLimiter Thread did not die after test ended
* Fixed bug #15 - custom config file was not being properly located
* Improvement #11 - Added IntelliJ IDEA support for AScripts code-completion
* Added support for running several AScripts, in sequence, located in a given directory
* Improvement #16 - the JavaFX Stage is brought to front before any action if necessary.
  This feature can be disabled by setting the config property `automaton.javafx.disableBringStageToFront` to true
* Added new method (enterText) to improve support for entering unicode characters in text fields
* Added new methods (getFocusedComponent) for Swing drivers, (getFocusedTextInputControl) for JavaFX drivers
* Added new property (initialized) to FXApp to allow JavaFX tests to know when the application has started up
* Added new method (initializeIfStageExists) to FXApp which allows test code to find and access an existing Stage.
  For example: FXApp.initializeIfStageExists(); Stage stage = FXApp.getStage();
* Improvement #19 - Preliminary JavaFX-drivers support for Mac OS X
* #21 - Created Automaton JavaFX Demo to mirror the Swing Demo
* #22 - Added support for running JavaFX and JavaFX/Swing mixed-applications AScripts
* AScripts now can give the required Speed to any call without having to import the Speed class.
  For example to move very fast to a button, the click on it: clickOn 'the-button', VERY_FAST
* Upgraded Groovy version to 2.3.3 - this is expected to allow Automaton to run on both Java 7 and Java 8
* Automaton is now published on Bintray's JCenter, making it easier to add it as a Maven/Gradle/Ivy dependency
