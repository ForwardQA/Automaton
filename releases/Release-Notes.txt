* Added new property (initialized) to FXApp to allow JavaFX tests to know when the application has started up

* Upgraded Groovy version to 2.3.3 - this is expected to allow Automaton to run on both Java 7 and Java 8
* Automaton is now published on Bintray's JCenter, making it easier to add it as a Maven/Gradle/Ivy dependency
